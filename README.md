# ActiveFinder – CA2 Web Mapping Project

This repo contains my CA2 project for the Full-Stack Web Mapping module.

The idea of the app is:
- Show real sports facilities around Dublin on an interactive Leaflet map
- Let the user filter by sport type (gym, pool, court, rink, stadium, other)
- Let the user use their location and search within a radius
- Show basic example “events” for some facilities

### Tech stack

- Django + GeoDjango
- PostGIS (via Docker)
- Django REST Framework for the `/api/facilities/` endpoints
- Leaflet.js on the frontend
- Data imported from OpenStreetMap using a small custom management command

### How to run locally

1. Create and activate a virtual environment  
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
